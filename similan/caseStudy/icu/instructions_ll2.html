		<h3>1. Load the data file</h3> 
		<p>
			Load file from the menu
			<div align="center">
				<img src="img/1_open.png"/>
			</div>
		</p>

		<h3>2. Use sequence filter</h3>
		<p>
			Use sequence filter "ICU", "Floor", "ICU" to find patients who have the sequence regardless of time and click on "Keep Selected"
			<div align="center">
				<img src="img/2_sequence.png"/>
			</div>
		</p>
		
		<h3>3. Save record as a new group</h3>
		<p>
			14 patients were selected. Click on "Save Records as New Group" to save this group. Name it "ICU->Floor->ICU".
			<div align="center">
				<img src="img/3_saveGroup.png"/>
			</div>
		</p>
		 
		<h3>4. Align</h3>
		<p>
		Align by <u>all occurrences</u> of "Floor". We then call "Floor" the <i>Sentinel</i> event. 
		The program may ask you about duplication. Please click "Proceed". 
			<div align="center">
				<img src="img/4_align.png"/>
			</div>
		</p>
		
		<h3>5. Filter by the distribution of "ICU" after the sentinel event</h3>
		<p>		 
		Show the distribution of ICU from the combobox. 
		Draw a selection on the bar chart to select patients who were moved to ICU within 2 days after the sentinel event ("Floor").
			<div align="center">
				<img src="img/5_1.png"/>
			</div>
		Click on "Keep Selected".
			<div align="center">
				<img src="img/5_2.png"/>
			</div>
		</p>
		
		<h3>6. Filter by the distribution of "ICU" before the sentinel event</h3>
		<p>
		Within the result set from 5., select all patients who were in ICU before the sentinel event, which means they were transferred from ICU to Floor first, by drawing a selection on the bar charts.
			<div align="center">
				<img src="img/6_1.png"/>
			</div>
		Click on "Keep Selected".
			<div align="center">
				<img src="img/6_2.png"/>
			</div>
		</p>
		 
		<h3>7. Manually remove non-relevant results</h3>
		<p>
		Patient #45665487 and #45755213 were transferred within the floor a few times before they were transferred back to ICU so they should not be selected. 
		</p>
		
		<h3>8. Done</h3>
		<p>
		This is the result. 5 patients from 244 patients were transferred from ICU to floor and transferred back to ICU within 2 days.
