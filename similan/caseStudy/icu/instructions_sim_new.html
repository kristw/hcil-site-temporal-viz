		<h2>Finding Patients Who Were Transferred from ICU to Floor and Back to ICU within 2 Days</h2>
		
		<p>
		This page provides instructions on how to find patients who were transferred from ICU (Intensive Care Unit) to Floor (Normal Bed) and transferred back to ICU within 2 days using Similan (http://www.cs.umd.edu/hcil/similan). You must have Similan installed on your machine before performing this task. These instructions must be followed exactly.  
		</p>
		
		<p>
		<b>Caution:</b> Make sure that your data is in the correct LifeLines2/Similan format.
		</p>
		
		<p>
		
		<h3>1. Load the data file</h3> 
		<p>
			1.1 Click on "File" from the menu and click on "Load Data...". A dialog box will appear. 
			<br>
			1.2 Select the data file and click on "Load".

			</div>
		</p>
	 
		<h3>2. Adjust the time reference point (Align) to the time that patients went to floor</h3>
		<p>
		Click on the drop-down list under "Align by" label and select "Floor". We then call "Floor" the <i>sentinel</i> event.

			</div>
		</p>
		
		<h3>3. Draw the events on the timeline</h3>
		<p>		 
		3.1 Click on "edit". 
		<br>
		3.2 Click on "Create new target". 
		<br>
		3.3 Select category and click on the "Add" button. The cursor will change to magic wand.
		<br>
		3.4 Click on the timeline to place event at that location.
		In this case, place "Floor" at time zero and "ICU" before "Floor" 
		and another ICU at one day after time zero (because it is the middle of 2 days).

				<img src="img/s_target.png"/>
			</div>
		</p>
		
		<h3>4. Set the range</h3>
		<p>
		Draw a selection on the top of the timeline to specify range of interest (indicated by red line). 
		In this case, set the range to 15 days before Floor until 2 days after Floor.
			<div align="center">
				<img src="img/s_scope.png"/>
			</div>
		</p>
		 
		<h3>5. Search</h3>
		<p>
		Click on "Search" and you will get the results. 
		The most similar records (by default definition of similarity) are on the top.
			<div align="center">
				<img src="img/s_search.png"/>
			</div>
		</p>
		
		<h3>6. Filter</h3>
		<p>
		To increase the precision of the result, we can set the filters. 
		<br>
		6.1 Click on "Filters" tab.
		<br>
		6.2
		There must be at least two ICU in this range.
		So, set the minimum value of the slider "Number of ICU" to 2.  
		<br>
		6.3 Click on "Apply Filter".

			</div>
		</p>
		
		<h3>7. Done</h3>
		<p>
		This is the result. 
		In this example, the top 7 patients from 244 patients were transferred from ICU to floor and transferred back to ICU within 2 days.
