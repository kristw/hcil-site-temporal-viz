				<h3>Introduction</h3>
				<p>
					We looked at the Apache web logs from the 
					<a href="http://en.childrenslibrary.org/">International Children's Digital Library</a>
					to analyze how people read children books online. <br>
					This sample dataset was taken from the period Jul 01-07, 2011.
					The original size of the dataset was about 1GB.
				</p>
				<p>
					We filtered the log entries to select only the http requests to access an actual book page:<br>
					<pre>"http://www.childrenslibrary.org/icdl/BookPage"</pre>
					Each request contains a query string behind the url, such as<br> 
					<pre>"bookid=amrdima_00310002&pnum1=6&pnum2=7&twoPage=true&lang=English&ilang=English"</pre>
					We parsed the page number and book id from this query string then group the http requests by IP address and book id into records.<br>
					Each record represents how each IP address (user) read one book, or a <i>book session</i>. 
					
					<pre>
IP address + book id		Page 	Time
133.37.60.191_radjese_00380046	2	2011-06-30 05:01:06
133.37.60.191_radjese_00380046	1	2011-06-30 05:01:14
133.37.60.191_radjese_00380046	2	2011-06-30 05:01:20
133.37.60.191_radjese_00380046	4	2011-06-30 05:01:25
133.37.60.191_radjese_00380046	6	2011-06-30 05:01:27</pre>
					
					We included only the first 30 pages in the dataset.  
					The processed dataset has 7,022 records and 57,709 rows in total.

				<img src="img/case_icdl1/1_readingForward.png">
				<div class="floatBox" style="right: 25px; top:160px;">
					We encoded the page number using color gradient<br> 
					from blue <svg width="10" height="10"><rect width="10" height="10" style="fill:rgb(66, 146, 198)"></svg> 
					to red <svg width="10" height="10"><rect width="10" height="10" style="fill:rgb(165, 15, 21)"></svg>.<br>
					
					<p>
					Because people also can the books in two mode:<br> 
					single-page (1,2,3, ...)<br> 
					and double-page (1,2,4,6, ...),<br>
					we hid the odd pages.
					</p>

				<img src="img/case_icdl1/2_readingForward_annotated.png">
				<div class="floatBox" style="right: 25px; top:350px; width: 400px;">
					We found that people started their reading on different pages.<br>
					Some started from the first page but some jumped into the later pages,
					probably skipping the empty pages in the beginning.
					<p>
						The height of the bars shows that people started on the earlier pages more than the later pages. 
					</p>
					<p>
						The color bars show a smooth gradient meaning that people mostly read in order.
						(Remember that the color coding is a gradient from blue to red.)
					</p>
				</div>

				<img src="img/case_icdl1/4_alignedBySecond_annotated.png">
				<div class="floatBox" style="left: 320px; top:160px; width: 200px;">
					We aligned by the second page to see how people read from the second page on.
					<p>
						The decreasing height of the bars as time went by shows that people gradually dropped out while reading.  
					</p>
					<p>
						The little long lines that split from the main trend in each step tell that some readers flipped back to the previous page before continued reading.
						The color changed to a little bit darker color (previous page) then changed back to the brighter colors (continue reading).
					</p>
					<p>
						We also noticed some long patterns before the second page.  
					</p>
				</div>

				<img src="img/case_icdl1/6_readingBackward_annotated.png">
				<div class="floatBox" style="left: 320px; top:160px; width: 300px;">
					We zoomed into the mysterious sequence from the previous screen and saw people reading backwards.
					(The color changes from red to blue instead of blue to red.)
					<p>
						We were curious so we selected them to see more detail.
					</p>
				</div>

			<div>
				<img src="img/case_icdl1/8_readingBackward2_annotated.png">
				<div class="floatBox" style="left: 320px; top:160px; width: 200px;">
					In the detail view, we saw one reader started reading from page 30 and flipped back all the way to page 2.
					Another reader read from page 4 to the end and flipped back all the way.
					And many more cases.
				</div>		
			</div>
			<div>
				<img src="img/case_icdl1/11_table.png">
				<div class="floatBox" style="left: 340px; top:490px; width: 230px;">
					We checked the attributes of these books. 
					They are in English and Spanish (left-to-right languages).<br>
					So there should not be any confusion about reading direction.
				</div>		
			</div>
			<div>
				<img src="img/case_icdl1/12_measureForward.png">
				<div class="floatBox" style="right: 100px; top:240px; width: 230px;">
					To investigate further, we measured the time from page 2 to page 30 when users accessed the pages in forward direction. 
					<p>
						The mean and median time were 25:02 and 4:45 minutes, respectively.
					</p>
				</div>		
			</div>
			<div>
				<img src="img/case_icdl1/13_measureBackward.png">
				<div class="floatBox" style="right: 400px; top:255px; width: 250px;">
					We also measured the time from page 30 to page 2 when users accessed the pages in backward direction. 
					<p>
						The mean and median time were 33 and 24 seconds, respectively, which is approximately one second per page.
					</p>
					<p>
						Seems like they were not reading backwards, just flipping.
					</p>
				</div>

				<div class="textBox">
				<h3>Conclusion</h3>
				<p>
					We dug deeper into several records with backward access one-by-one and hypothesized a few possible scenarios. 
					<ul>
						<li>
							<b>Finished reading a part of the book</b>:
							For example, one reader read from page 10 to 18 which is exactly one chapter of the book,
							then flipped back to page 1 and did not have any interaction after that.
						</li>
						<li>
							<b>Shelf books</b>:
							ICDL has a membership system, which a member can store books on his/her virtual shelf for reading later.
							The system also remembers the last page read by the member.  
							However, we assumed that some members might open the book and find it at page 30, 
							so they tried to flip it back to the first page and start reading again from the beginning.  
						</li>
						<li>
							<b>Parent preview</b>:
							Some users read a few pages then flipped back to the beginning and started reading from the beginning.
							We assumed that this is a behavior of parents selecting books for their children.
							They flipped a few pages to check that it is suitable then went back to the beginning to read it.   
						</li>
					</ul>
					From these three possible scenarios,
					the users seem to depend heavily on the page-by-page (previous/next button) navigation.
					To change from page 30 back to page 1, they went to the previous page 30 times instead of using other controls that could let them jump to page 1 faster.
					This could be because the users could use their arrow keys to go to previous/next page, which was convenient for them, so they kept pressing the arrow keys,
					or the users did not know how to jump back to the first page directly. 
				</p>
				<p>
					However, to find the real explanation why many people access the online children books backwards or does the navigation need to be improved
					will require a further user study, which is beyond the scope of this case study.
					Therefore, we would like to take a step back and summarize what we learned from the ICDL web logs so far using LifeFlow.
				</p>
				<p>
					LifeFlow showed potential for helping the ICDL administrator understand how people are accessing the online books.
					It highlighted the users' reading behaviors from the majority that read in order, 
					the readers that skipped the the blank early pages right to the content,
					the readers that flipped back and continue reading, to the readers that flipped backwards all the way back to the first page. 
					By understanding these behaviors better, the administrator can improve the website to suit the readers better.
