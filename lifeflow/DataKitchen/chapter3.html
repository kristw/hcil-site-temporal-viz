<h1>Chapter 3: Control of the instructions</h1>
<p>Everytime the users performed some task (e.g. modification to the data), the instruction corresponds to the task are kept in the Instruction Panel as a list of buttons. Clicking the buttons shows the detail about that instruction, which is also kept in the log file. To avoid repeating the tedious operation of converting similar data (e.g. the data obtained in different years), a recipe can be created by the users. A Recipe contains a list of instruction, which can be opened and applied easily. In the bottom of Instruction Panel, four buttons are used to re-do/un-do the changes. The instruction is colored in yellow, green, and gray respectively when it is already applied, currently the applied last instruction, or not applied. Note that un-do a change does not remove the instruction from the list of instructions. Un-used instructions (e.g. gray ones) will only be removed from the list when a new instruction is being added to the list.</p>

<p>When the users performed another task, the instructions in gray will be removed. The newly performed task will be the new last executed task.</p>

<h2><a name = "3.1">3.1 Un-do/Re-do</a></h2>
The four buttons in the bottom of Instruction Panel are used to control which instructions are used. From left to right, the buttons are used to revert to the original, un-do last instruction, re-do next instruction, and re-do all instructions.
