		Fixing bugs is like solving mysteries. 
		We wish we could eliminate all of them, but it is, sigh~, impossible. 
		So we will try to fix as much as we can to make LifeFlow stable and behave nicely. 
		Here are some bugs that we knew about but couldn't figure out how to fix it 
		and suggestions or temporary workaround that may help you while we track them down.

<li>Sometimes the Timeline panel stop rendering for no reason.</li>
<p class = "textBox">
	<b>Description:</b><br>
	The Timeline panel is blank when the dataset is not empty. 
	We found it a few times but could not reproduce the bug.
	It also rarely occurs.
	Please let us know if you know how to reproduce the bug.
</p>
<p class = "textBox">
	<b>Temporary solution:</b><br> 
	Double-click on the scrollbar of the timeline panel will force the Timeline panel to redraw.
